### Functions

Simply put, functions are sections that perform actions and that can be called to perform the action several times without having to repeat the code.

The functions are extremely useful for several reasons:
* Code reuse -> No need to rewrite all the logic in the sections because it already exists;
* Standardization -> The entire section will perform the ordered action;

The functions are extremely useful for these and other reasons.
