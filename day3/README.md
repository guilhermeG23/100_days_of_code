### Typing

The typing is different for each type of language, it largely depends on the focus of the language and the audience it serves:
* Strongly -> Needs to define the type of data that will be used and does not allow receiving another type;
* Weakly -> It is more flexible, being able to change the type of data that is fed;

Typing can also be explicit or implicit, it depends a lot on the language too, a cool example is GO/PHP, where you can approach both ways:
* Explicit -> Need to define the type of value that will be received, anything beyond that type of value will be denied;
* Implicit -> There is no need to define the type of data that will be received, the language engine will define the type based on the value fed;
